## Motivation

## Novelty

方法：在所有 base classes 使用监督学习预训练一个分类器，再使用如原型网络的 meta-learning 方法学习一次，就可以得到很好的 sota 指标。

why：

1. In the meta-learning stage, we observe that a model generalizing better on unseen tasks from base classes can have a decreasing performance on tasks from novel classes, *indicating a potentialobjective discrepancy*.

1. We find both pre-training and inheriting a good few-shot classification metric from the pre-trained classifier are importantfor Meta-Baseline, which potentially helps the model better utilize the pre-trained representations with stronger transferability.
